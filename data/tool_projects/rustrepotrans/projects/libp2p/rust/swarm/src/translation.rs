use libp2p_core::{multiaddr::Protocol, Multiaddr};

/// Perform IP address translation.
///
/// Given an `original` [`Multiaddr`] and some `observed` [`Multiaddr`], replace the first protocol
/// of the `original` with the first protocol of the `observed` [`Multiaddr`] and return this
/// translated [`Multiaddr`].
///
/// This function can for example be useful when handling tcp connections. Tcp does not listen and
/// dial on the same port by default. Thus when receiving an observed address on a connection that
/// we initiated, it will contain our dialing port, not our listening port. We need to take the ip
/// address or dns address from the observed address and the port from the original address.
///
/// This is a mixed-mode translation, i.e. an IPv4 / DNS4 address may be replaced by an IPv6 / DNS6
/// address and vice versa.
///
/// If the first [`Protocol`]s are not IP addresses, `None` is returned instead.
